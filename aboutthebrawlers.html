      <h3>Edgar</h3>

      <p class="tx-sucess px-5">Edgar is an Epic Brawler.He has high and consistent burst damage and great mobility with his
        Super and his very fast movement speed, but low health and a short attack range. His Trait allows his Super to
        charge itself over time. His attacks throw two quick short-ranged punches with an extremely fast cooldown and
        reload
        speed that also slightly heal him per hit on an enemy Brawler. His Super is a quick jump over obstacles that
        grants
        him a speed boost upon landing. </p>

    <p>Amber is a Legendary Brawler that has moderate health and a high damage output. She attacks by shooting a
      continuous, long-ranged stream of fire. Amberâ€™s Super is a flask of fire fluid that creates a flammable puddle on
      the ground which can be ignited by her attack, and when ignited, sets enemies in it on fire to burn over time.</p>
